- Make it so the video doesn't dupplicate when you press button Done x- Joel took a  minute
- On side maybe have the percentage bars so we can check how sure it is # Ok done
- Further read text if it is a hazard symbol, so if there is additional text that says "flammable liquid" it'll tell you that
- Make video box fit into the white box #Idk what yall talking abt works fine for me
